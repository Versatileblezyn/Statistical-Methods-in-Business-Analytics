## Project Description – Acceptance of Technology (AI Adoption)

### What We Were Asked to Do
This project focused on understanding the adoption of an AI-based news aggregation and summarization application. The task was to analyze user acceptance of the technology using a Structural Equation Model (SEM) based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), with the inclusion of trust.

We were required to construct and compare two SEM models using the following latent variables: Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, Trust, and Behavioural Intention. The first model examined trust as a driver of performance expectancy, while the second model examined social influence as a driver of trust. We also analyzed the total effect of trust on behavioural intention and discussed managerial implications for AI adoption.

### What We Did
We developed and tested two alternative SEM models using survey data collected from potential users who tested the AI service. Both models met acceptable fit criteria; however, the model where social influence drives trust demonstrated superior performance across key fit indices, including CFI, TLI, RMSEA, AIC, and BIC. As a result, this model was selected as the better representation of technology acceptance in this context.

To further investigate the role of trust, we conducted a mediation analysis to examine its total effect on behavioural intention. The results showed that trust had a strong and statistically significant direct effect on behavioural intention, while the indirect effect through performance expectancy was weak and not significant. This indicates that trust functions as an independent and central driver of AI adoption rather than acting mainly through perceived performance benefits.

### Managerial Implications
The findings suggest that trust is a critical factor in users’ willingness to adopt AI-based services. While performance expectancy and facilitating conditions also influence adoption, building trust through transparency, reliability, and social validation is essential. Social influence plays a key role in shaping trust, highlighting the importance of reputation, peer opinions, and credible communication when introducing AI-driven products to the market.

### What I Learned
This project strengthened my understanding of how SEM can be used to evaluate technology adoption models. I learned how trust, social influence, and perceived usefulness interact in shaping behavioural intention, and how empirical model comparison can support evidence-based managerial decision-making in AI adoption.
